title: Version Control with Git
---

[Version control](reference.html#version-control) is the best way of collaborating on any coding project. It keeps a snapshot of all changes ever made by both parties, and merges these changes gracefully. Now I know what some of you may be thinking: "What if I'm going to be the only one working on a project? What if I don't want anyone else to see my code? Why not use a service like Dropbox instead if I want a backup?"

Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone
researchers can benefit immensely.  Keeping a record of what was
changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they
ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later,
when memory has faded).

Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it's what
professionals use to keep track of what they've done and to
collaborate with other people.  Every large software development
project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs
as well.  And it isn't just for software: books,
papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs
to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.


Here's the scenario for our lesson:

Wolfman and Dracula have been hired by Universal Missions (a space
services spinoff from Euphoric State University) to investigate if it
is possible to send their next planetary lander to Mars.  They want to
be able to work on the plans at the same time, but they have run into
problems doing this in the past.  If they take turns, each one will
spend a lot of time waiting for the other to finish, but if they work
on their own copies and email changes back and forth things will be
lost, overwritten, or duplicated. They will use version control to solve
these problems!
