Wolfman and Dracula have been hired by Universal Missions (a space
services spinoff from Euphoric State University) to investigate if it
is possible to send their next planetary lander to Mars.  They want to
be able to work on the plans at the same time, but they have run into
problems doing this in the past.  If they take turns, each one will
spend a lot of time waiting for the other to finish, but if they work
on their own copies and email changes back and forth things will be
lost, overwritten, or duplicated.

A colleague suggests using [version control]({{ page.root }}/reference#version-control) to
manage their work. Version control is better than mailing files back and forth and offers more features
than collaborating on a single document hosted in the cloud. 

*   Nothing that is committed [or saved] to a version controlled system is ever lost, unless
    you work really, really hard at it. Since all old versions of
    files are saved, it's always possible to go back in time to see
    exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a
    program was used to generate a particular set of results. 

*   As we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to ask
    if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a previous
    version, much like the "undo" feature in an editor.

*   When several people collaborate in the same project, it's possible to
    accidentally overlook or overwrite someone's changes. The version control
    system automatically notifies users whenever there's a conflict between one
    person's work and another's.

Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone
researchers can benefit immensely.  Keeping a record of what was
changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they
ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later,
when memory has faded).

Using a version control system is the lab notebook of the digital world: it's what
professionals use to keep track of what they've done and to
collaborate with other people.  Programmers use it for both large and small projects.
Version control systems are also useful for non-software-related projects. 
Any project like writing a book or paper; creating small data sets; or anything 
that changes over time and/or needs to be shared with 
others should be stored in a version control system.
